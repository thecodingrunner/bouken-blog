<h2>Description:</h2>
Experience Japan Through My Eyes: A Full-Stack Next.js Adventure Blog. Note: The live demo may take up to 15 seconds to initialize. If you encounter any issues, please refresh the page.

<h2>Project Purpose and Goal:</h2>
Immerse yourself in my journey across Japan through this dynamic, full-stack Next.js blog. Dive into vivid stories, stunning photos, and personal insights from my travels. This project aims to create an interactive platform for adventure enthusiasts to share their experiences. Inspired by my own journey cycling across Japan, I developed a website that not only showcases my personal blog but also invites others to contribute their unique adventures. The platform offers rich features for bloggers, including support for both landscape and portrait photos, categorization options, location tagging, and a favoriting system. On the homepage, a dynamic carousel displays featured (favorited) posts, complemented by a section highlighting recent entries. For easy navigation, separate pages are dedicated to each blog category, allowing users to explore content tailored to their interests. This versatile design encourages a vibrant community of travelers to document and share their explorations in a visually appealing and organized manner.

<h2>Webstack and Explanation:</h2>
This full-stack project leverages Next.js to implement a comprehensive blog platform with complete CRUD functionality. Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts seamlessly. The site's design, originally conceptualized in Figma, incorporates a range of fluid animations powered by Framer Motion. Firebase integration enables photo uploads for each blog post, while MongoDB serves as the database for storing user information and post content. To ensure security, Next Auth has been implemented, providing Google login functionality and restricting post creation, editing, and deletion to authenticated users only.
